---

Okay, let's get real. You're drowning in debt and bad spending habits. This is going to be tough, but you *can* survive this. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. REALITY CHECK

*   **Am I currently overspending? By how much?** YES. Catastrophically. Your average monthly spending is $844.17, while you only have $450.00 available after rent. That means you're overspending by **$394.17 per month.** This is unsustainable.
*   **What's my biggest problem area?** Impulsive, unnecessary spending. You're bleeding money on convenience and instant gratification. Walmart and Amazon are your biggest expenses, but the true problems are the small, frequent purchases: Vending machines, gas station snacks, DoorDash.
*   **What expenses are absolutely killing my budget?** DoorDash ($43.08/month), Vending Machines ($41.70/month), Gas Station Indiscretion ($45.35/month) - These are luxuries you absolutely cannot afford. Amazon and Walmart need serious scrutiny.

### 2. SURVIVAL BUDGET PLAN ($450.00/Month)

This is a *survival* budget. It's not fun, but it's necessary.

*   **Food (Groceries):** $200.00 This is roughly $6.67/day. This requires meal planning, cooking at home, and avoiding restaurants entirely.
*   **Transportation:** $30.00 (Gasoline and Bicycle Repair) - If you can bike or walk, do it!
*   **Utilities (Electricity):** $20.00. Be mindful of your usage. Unplug devices when not in use, use energy-efficient light bulbs, and be smart about heating/cooling.
*   **Phone:** $20.00. Look for the absolute cheapest plan possible, even if it means less data.
*   **Health Insurance:** $100.00. You MUST have health insurance. If you're eligible for a student plan, use it.
*   **Personal Care:** $20.00 (Toiletries, basic necessities). Cut out all non-essential items.
*   **Emergency Buffer:** $60.00. This is crucial. Every month, put this aside.

### 3. IMMEDIATE CUTS TO MAKE

*   **ELIMINATE COMPLETELY (Estimated Monthly Savings):**
    *   DoorDash: $43.08
    *   Vending Machine: $41.70
    *   Gas Station Indiscretion (Snacks/Drinks): $40.00 (Estimate, based on 87.7% of total)
    *   Chase Travel (Until debt is under control): $57.60
    *   Flights (Virgin Atlantic): $16.99
    *   Clothes (Century 21): $8.81
    *   Dining: $7.73
    *   Visa Services (Atlys): $6.47
    *   **Total Eliminated: $222.38**

*   **REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY (Target Amounts):**
    *   Walmart: Target $100.00/month. Focus ONLY on groceries and essential household items. No impulse buys.
    *   Amazon Shopping: Target $50.00/month. Only purchase items you absolutely need and have researched for the best price.
    *   Gasoline: Target $20.00/month (Only if absolutely necessary)

*   **Keep but Optimize:**
    *   Phone Service: Shop around for the cheapest possible plan. Consider prepaid options.
    *   Electricity: Be conscious of usage. Turn off lights, unplug devices, limit AC/heating use.
    *   Bicycle Repair: Learn basic maintenance yourself. Watch YouTube tutorials.
    *   Textbooks (Pearson): Explore used options, rentals, or digital versions.

### 4. SPECIFIC WARNINGS

*   **Your Worst Spending Habits:** Impulse buying, convenience spending, and lack of planning.
*   **The Hard Truth:**
    *   **Vending Machines:** These are a money pit. Stop it. Pack your own snacks and drinks.
    *   **Gas Station Snacks:** Same as vending machines. Plan ahead.
    *   **DoorDash:** You are paying a massive premium for convenience. Learn to cook and plan your meals.
    *   **Amazon & Walmart:** These are black holes for your money. You go in for one thing and come out with ten. Stick to your list.

### 5. WEEKLY SPENDING ALLOWANCE

*   **Weekly Cash Allowance:** $40.00 for groceries and other essentials. This is roughly $5.71/day for food.
*   **Autopay:**
    *   Rent
    *   Phone
    *   Health Insurance
    *   Electricity (Budget billing can help stabilize costs)

### 6. 30-DAY CHALLENGE

1.  **Track EVERYTHING:** Use a budgeting app (Mint, YNAB, etc.) to meticulously track every single penny you spend.
2.  **No Eating Out or Delivery:** Zero. Cook every meal at home.
3.  **No Vending Machines or Gas Station Snacks:** Pack your own.
4.  **Unsubscribe from Marketing Emails:** Stop the temptation before it starts.
5.  **Review Your Bank Statements Weekly:** Hold yourself accountable.
6.  **Find a "Spending Buddy":** Someone who will hold you accountable and offer support.
7.  **Create a "Wish List" for Non-Essentials:** When you want to buy something non-essential, put it on a list and wait 30 days. If you still want it after 30 days, re-evaluate if you can afford it.
8.  **Meal Prep:** Spend a few hours each week preparing meals in advance to avoid the temptation of eating out.
9.  **Audit Subscriptions:** Cancel any subscriptions you don't use regularly.
10. **Set a Financial Goal:** Define a clear financial goal, such as saving for an emergency fund, to stay motivated.

This is going to be difficult, but it is not impossible. You need to be disciplined and honest with yourself. If you slip up, don't give up. Just get back on track immediately. Your financial future depends on it. Good luck.
